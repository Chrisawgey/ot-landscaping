    text: "So grateful my neighbor introduced me to OT Landscaping. Ociel and his team do excellent work and consistently outperform any competitor I've tried. After a heavy rainstorm one Fourth of July left my yard a complete mess, they came out promptly and restored everything better than it looked before. That kind of reliability and dedication is rare — I won't use anyone else.",
